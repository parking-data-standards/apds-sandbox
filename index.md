## About APDS
### APDS: Context, Motivation
A few years back, the [International Parking &amp; Mobility Institute (**IPMI**)](https://ipmi.parking-mobility.org), the [British Parking Association (**BPA**)](https://www.britishparking.co.uk), and the [European Parking Association (**EPA**)](https://www.europeanparking.eu) formed a not-for-profit organization with the mission to develop, promote, manage, and maintain a uniform global standard that will allow organizations to share parking data across platforms worldwide: **APDS**, the [Alliance for Parking Data Standards](https://www.allianceforparkingdatastandards.org). 

## About this Repository
### APDS Specification
_APDS_ has developed the global parking data standard in form of a comprehensive (UML) model. This model is the source for the _APDS Specifications_ (overview, information model, data model, use cases). You can request the specification documents on the [APDS website](https://www.allianceforparkingdatastandards.org) free of charge.

### APDS API
The _APDS_ working group has also created a comprehensive representation of the APDS data model in form of an **API**. This interface is documented using the [OpenAPI Specification Standard](https://www.openapis.org) originally initiated by [Swagger](https://swagger.io) and then taken over by the **Open APIs** initiative. Depending on the particular application, there might be other ways to describe the model and a derived interface. But _APDS_ figured it would be a good starting point for adopters to have something readily available to base their work on. This repository contains said **APS OpenAPI Specification**.

A browsable version of the _APDS_ API specification can be found [here](/apiv4/index.html).
